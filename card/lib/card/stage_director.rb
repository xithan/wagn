class Card
  # A 'StageDirector' executes the stages of a card when the card gets created,
  # updated or deleted.
  # For subcards, i.e. other cards that are changed in the same act, a
  # StageDirector has StageSubdirectors that take care of the stages for
  # those cards
  #
  # In general a stage is executed for all involved cards before the
  # StageDirector proceeds with the next stage.
  # Only exception is the finalize stage.
  # The finalize stage of a subcard is executed immediately after its store
  # stage. When all subcards are finalized the supercard's finalize stage is
  # executed.
  #
  # If a subcard is added in a stage then it catches up at the end of the stage
  # to the current stage.
  # For example if you add a subcard in a card's :prepare_to_store stage then
  # after that stage the stages :initialize, :prepare_to_validate,
  # :validate and :prepare_to_store are executed for the subcard.
  #
  # Stages are executed with pre-order depth-first search.
  # That means if A has subcards AA and AB; AAA is subcard of AA and ABA
  # subcard of AB then the order of execution is
  # A -> AA -> AAA -> AB -> ABA
  #
  # A special case can happen in the store phase.
  # If the id of a subcard is needed for a supercard
  # (for example as left_id or as type_id) and the subcard doesn't
  # have an id yet (because it gets created in the same act)
  # then the subcard's store stage is executed before the supercard's store
  # stage
